# Production-Level ML Coding Skills

## Overview
This repository documents my journey to learn production-quality machine learning engineering skills using PyTorch. The focus is on transforming research code into robust, maintainable, and scalable production code. More details and updates will be added as the project evolves.

## Current Objectives
- **Project Structure & Outline:**  
  Establish a clear folder structure that separates data handling, model definitions, training scripts, and utility functions.
- **Modular Code & OOP Practices:**  
  Develop reusable functions and classes. Apply object-oriented programming principles to create clean, maintainable code.
- **Packaging and Environment Setup:**  
  Create packaging files (e.g., `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`) to facilitate installation, and manage dependencies with `requirements.txt` or an environment YAML file.
